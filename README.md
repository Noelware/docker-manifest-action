# 🐻‍❄️🐳 Docker Manifest GitHub Action

> _Simple and tiny GitHub action to link [Docker manifests](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/manifest) easily._

**docker-manifest-action** is a simple and tiny GitHub action to link [Docker manifests](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/manifest) easily without managing it yourself, just input one or more images and merge multiple manifests into one Docker manifest.

Do note that **docker-manifest-action** is in beta stages (and might not work properly!), so please create [issues](https://github.com/Noelware/docker-manifest/action/issues/new) so that we can make this production ready!

## Usage

```yaml
on:
  push:
steps:
  - name: Create and push manifest images
    uses: Noelware/docker-manifest-action@master # or use a pinned version in the Releases tab
    with:
      inputs: namespace/image:latest
      images: namespace/image:latest-amd64[,namespace/other-image:latest-arm64]
      push: true
```

## Inputs

> **Warning** -- As of v0.3, `base-image` has been renamed to `inputs` and `extra-images` has been renamed to `images`. The former inputs will work but will be deprecated into v0.4!

### inputs

> Type: String
>
> Required: True
Image name(s), optionally comma separated, that the final image manifest will be called.


#### Example

```yaml
inputs: namespace/image:latest
images: namespace/image:latest-amd64,namespace/image:latest-arm64
```
In this example, the two images from `images` will be combined to create the final `inputs`.

### images

> Type: String
>
> Required: True

Comma-seperated list of images that will be applied to the merged manifest(s) defined in [inputs](#inputs).

#### Example

```yaml
inputs: namespace/image:latest
images: namespace/image:latest-amd64,namespace/image:latest-arm64
```
In this example, the two images from `images` will be combined to create the final `inputs`.

### push

> Type: Boolean
>
> Required: False
>
> Default: `false`

If the final [images](#images)  should be pushed or not.

### amend

> Type: Boolean
>
> Required: False
>
> Default: `false`

If the action should apply the **--amend** flag to `docker manifest create` (and `docker manifest push` if [push](#push) is true). This is useful if the action has created a manifest but had errored when creating (or pushing) a merged manifest.

## Common Issues

### [image] is a manifest list

Add **provenance: false** when using the `docker/build-push-action` GitHub action before using **Noelware/docker-manifest-action**, related issue: [#131](https://github.com/Noelware/docker-manifest-action/issues/131)
